# Py Web Data
Couple of scripts for parsing XML/JSON and HTML

# Requirements
Script extractor_JSON.py must have file named "google_maps_api_key" with proper Geo Maps Google API key.
If you do not have Geo Maps Google API key then you have to generate it here first: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/get-api-key then put into "google_maps_api_key" file.
